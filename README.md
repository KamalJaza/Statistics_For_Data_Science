# Measure of Central Tendency
### Mean
Mean represents the average of the given collection of data. It is applicable for both continuous and discrete data.
- All scores in distribution affected the mean.
- Many samples from the same population will have similar means.
- The mean will change if we add extreme value.
### Median
Median represents the mid-value of the given set of data when arranged in a particular order.
- Doesn't change much by extreme values (outliers).
- Median is a robust statistics.
### Mode
The most frequent number occurring in the data set is known as the mode.
# Measure of Spread / Dispersion
### Range
It is simply the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value given in a data set.
### Variance
- Variance is the expected value of the squared variation of a random variable from its mean value, in probability and statistics.
- Informally, variance estimates how far a set of numbers (random) are spread out from their mean value.
### Standard Deviation
The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.
- A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set.
- While a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.
